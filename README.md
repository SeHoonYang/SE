# כתר
Keter means Crown in hebrew.

# How to run
Execute make.bat to make an executable file.
Note that tcc only works on the windows environment,
thus you won't be able to run this project on your mac, linux and so on.

Run "run.bat" that is located in the release directory to start the executable file properly.
Since this project is based on korean cmd line environment, it uses #949 code page.
"run.bat" will temporarily change your code page automatically.

* You should install code page 949 first. See : https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/164948
